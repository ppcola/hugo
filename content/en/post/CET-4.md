### December 2019 Translation Test Answer Set 3:Han Names

> Question:

```
中国汉族人的全名由姓和名组成。中文姓名的特点是，姓总是在前，名跟在其后。千百年来，父姓一直世代相传。然而，如今，孩子跟母亲姓并不罕见。一般来说，名有一个或两个汉字，通常承载父母对孩子的愿望。从孩子的名字可以推断出父母希望孩子成为什么样的人，或者期望他们过什么样的生活。父母非常重视给孩子取名，因为名字往往会伴随孩子一生。
```

> Refernce translation:

The full name of a Han Chinese consists of a family name and a given name. A distinctive feature of the Chinese name is that the family name always comes first, followed by the given name. For thousands of years, Chinese family names have been passed down through the father. Nowadays, however, it is not uncommon for a child to adopt the mother's family name. Generally, a given name is made up of one or two characters, usually carrying the parents' wishes for their child. It can be inferred from the name what kind of person the parents want their child to be, or what kind of life they expect him or her to lead. Chinese parents attach great importance to the choice of their child's name, as the name tends to accompany the child for his or her entire life.
